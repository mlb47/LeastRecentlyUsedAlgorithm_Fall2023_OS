# LeastRecentlyUsedAlgorithm_Fall2023_OS

This program was created for a Fundamentals of Operating Systems course and practices the Least Recently Used Algorithm for memory management.

The program simulates the Least Recently Used Algorithm, which allocates frames in memory by removing the frame that was least recently accessed.

Along with displaying the allocated frames, this program will also give the number of page faults experienced.

The program can be run with the makefile by using the command `make`
